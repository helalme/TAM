This software kit can be used for solving 3D inverse heat conduction problems.
Test examples are used for 2D pipe case. Both forware and inverse problems can be solved.


How to Use:
  1. Go to TAM>Debug>TAM.exe,    an interactive window will pop up showing the target directory
  2. Close the UI window  
  3. Put all input files into the target directory, shown at the beginning of the window.
  4. Rerun the program. It will show each .txt file with a number.
  5. select forward or inverse by entering corresponding number.
  6. It will ask for two input data files, reference data and inner temperature data for Forward problems
	and outerTemp data for inverse problems.
  7. The program will generate a message when result file is generated.
